Description: This code reproduces the main results from Edwards et al. (2019) 
    Nature: the projections at 2100 for MICI and NoMICI, and the simulator plots 
    using the high Pliocene calibration. It is also possible to run the 
    sensitivity tests for discrepancy (zero and double) and VCLIF 4 km/a by
    editing main.R. The only aspects not included are non-2100 results and 
    leave-one-out validation of the emulator.
